Test Calculator Application

Task 1: On first running the program you can enter the first number followed by the operator and second number. The result 
of the calculation is then displayed. 
On completion the program will then move onto Task 2. 

Task 2: Enter a full mathematical expression e.g. 2 *2 
The result is then displayed and the program will move onto task 3. 

Task 3: Not fully implemented, but entering an expression will proceed back to Task 1. 

The ability to display the help menu and exit the program are included but I had a issue where input was taken twice 
so I decided to remove it from the flow for now.
